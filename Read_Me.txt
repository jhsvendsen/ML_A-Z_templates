Inside "Code_and_Data" folder you will find a wide range of templates
for machine learning and others.

I have on purpose left all templates and data in the same folder, so
that you can quickly open new templates without having to chance the 
path to be able to run it. Below I will make a list which you can refer
to, when you need to find the desired template.

These templates were created during the udemy course: 
Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science

I highly recomend this course to anyone wanting to get better at machine learning.

1. Regression (regress) templates:
- linear regression
- multi linear regression
- support vector regression
- decision tree regression
- random forest regression

2. Classification (class) templates:
- logistic regression
- support vector machine (SVM)
- kernel SVM
- naive bayes
- decission tree classification
- random forest classification

3. Clustering (clus) templates:
- K-Means clustering
- hierarchical clustering

4. Association rules learning templates:
- apriori
	- here I have also put a file apyori which is called in apriori
- eclat

5. Reinforcement learning templates:
- upper confidence bound
- thompson sampling

7. Natural language sampling (NLP) template:
- natural language sampling
	- here you can change the classifier to compare results

8. Deep learning templates:
- artificial neural network
- convolutional neural networks

9. Dimensionality reduction templates:
- principal component analysis (PCA)
- linear discriminant analysis
- kernel PCA

10. Model selection & boosting templates:
- k-fold cross validation
- grid search
- XGBoost

All of these files should have a Python and R script.
- convolutional neural networks is not mature in R and is therefore not made.

This is made to help anyone interested in seing how much code it takes to get
started, but is also for my future self to be able to go back and use.

I have many ideas for projects and will try and uploade these to my website,
as i get going with them.
